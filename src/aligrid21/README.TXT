TStringAlignGrid  (Version 2.1 of 2001-07-09)

Originally it was a descendant of TStringGrid with the possibility to change
the alignment of the text to left (same as StringGrid) or right aligned or
centered and only 4k source code, but with each new version more features
appeared but the name stayed (as there is already a TSuperGrid I've to stick
to the name...), and it now has 200k of source, and there are still further
items on my to do list.

For the quick use: move the PAS, DCR and DFM files into your component path and
include it with the file aligridr.pas in your library. You can then just drop
it onto your forms and set all the needed properties with the component editor
(just double-click the grid and the see the popup menu which comes after a
click with the right mouse button). For users of Delphi 3 or later there's
also a package file, which only includes this one component, just load this
file in Delphi and select "Install package" - but you can of course add this
component to any other package you like, too, by using the aligridr.pas file.

This component is Freeware. If you like it you can send me a thank you
on a nice postcard from your hometown, but if you really want to send me
money I won't complain :-) , but count it as a gift not a payment. If you use
this component in one of your projects I'd appreciate it if you mention me
somewhere. Only spread this component complete with all the readme's and
sources.

For documentation, contact information etc. read the help file supplied with
the component.

Have fun,
  Andreas H"orstemeier
