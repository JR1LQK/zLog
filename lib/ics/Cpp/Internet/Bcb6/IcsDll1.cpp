Description:  This is a demo showing how to use a TWSocket component in a DLL.
              This demo must be used with ICS TcpSrv demo program as a server.
              The DLL is a client which connect to the server and send "time"
              command, then wait for the reply and return it in the buffer
              passed to the DLL.
              There is only one function exported from the DLL: IcsDllDemo.
              It takes four arguments: a pointer to the hostname to connect to,
              a pointer to the port, a pointer to a buffer and a pointer for
              buffer size. On entry buffer size must be initialised with the
              size of the actual buffer. On exit, it is filled with the
              actual reply size. The function's return value is the error code
              such as 10061 when the server is not running.
