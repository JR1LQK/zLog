TSuperGrid Version 1.4 - by Pablo Pissanetzky - pablo@neosoft.com
----------------------------------------------------------------- 

New for Version 1.4
-------------------
* The property editor now has an entirely new look ( to make room for
  more features ).
* Added separate vertical alignment for the headings and the contents.
* Headings can now have bevels. Just like TPanel, the user can control
  the inner and outer bevels as well as the bevel and border widths.
* TSuperGrid can now hold three different types of checkboxes in its 
  cells along with text. There is a new property called Checked that 
  allows the user to read or set the state of each checkbox. There is 
  also an event, OnCheckBoxClick, that is triggered whenever the state 
  of a checkbox is changed by clicking on a cell. You can specify whether
  the checkboxes will be intially checked at design time. No coding
  required!
* Added a DeleteRow method ( Something TStringGrid should've had from the start )
* Added an InsertRow method ( Something TStringGrid should've had from the start )
* Added some version checking so that future versions of TSuperGrid will
  always be compatible with the older ones.
* Graphics and checkboxes in the cells now assume the same vertical 
  alignment as the contents of the column, not just top-left.
* Added a SaveCells method that writes the contents of TSuperGrid to a comma 
  delimited file that can be read with the existing LoadCells method.

IF YOU ARE A CURRENT USER OF TSUPERGRID AND ARE UPGRADING TO 1.4:

Version 1.4 has new properties that did not exist in previous versions.
As such, to be able to use your existing projects that contain a TSuperGrid
Version 1.3 or older, you must do the following:

 1) First, Close the current project and all open files.
 2) Install TSuperGrid Version 1.4 as described below.
 3) Open each project that contains a TSuperGrid Version 1.3.
    !!Do not try to run the project!!
 4) Change something on each form that contains a TSuperGrid. You can 
    just move the TSuperGrid a couple of pixels.
 5) Save the project.
 6) You TSuperGrid(s) have now been converted to comply with Version 1.4.

    What happens is that Version 1.4 detects that it is reading 
    a Pre-1.4 DFM file and does not attempt to read the values of
    new properties, it just sets them to their default. When you change and 
    save your project, the DFM file is written out as a Version 1.4 with all
    the new properties and you can keep on trucking. This is the only way
    to make a component like this one, backward compatible. It updates itself.

IF YOU GET ERRORS SAYING THAT PROPERTIES DO NOT EXIST, I WARNED YOU! :)

Features
--------	

The TSuperGridT Component is an enhanced TStringGrid. It allows you to 
change the way a string grid looks in a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get 
manner. With TSuperGrid, you can have a grid populated with data and 
formatted at design time, without writing a single line of code. 
You can also easily change any of its many properties at run time.

It adds a single property to TStringGrid, called Columns.  
The Columns property allows you to change virtually all aspects of 
the string grid at design time with a Windows 95 style, user friendly 
property editor as well as at run time. 
With Columns you can do the following:

* Give each column a multi line title.
* Align each column's title to the left, right or centered.
* Dynamically change the width of each column by typing a new 
  value or using a slider.
* Give each column title its own background color.
* Specify a different font for each column title, change the 
  style, size, and color of the font.
* Specify how to clip each cell. If the text does not fit in a 
  cell, TSuperGridT can either clip it, add an ellipsis, or 
  wrap the words for multiple lines of  text in each cell.
* Align the contents of each row to the left, right or centered.
* Specify a background color for the contents of each row.
* Specify a font ( style, size and color ) for the contents 
  of each row.
* Dynamically change the height of any row by typing a new value 
  or using a slider.
* Give even and/or odd rows their own background color.
* Specify a comma-delimited file to populate the grid, 
  create and edit the file at design time. 
  You can specify whether to strip leading and trailing blanks 
  from each item in the file, and whether the grid should add 
  rows to accomodate all the lines in the data file.
* New for Version 1.2! You can load bitmaps, icons or windows meta
  files into each cell of TSuperGrid at design time or run time.

The property editor has an Apply button that allows you to see 
all the changes you make instantly take effect on the grid. 
If you specify a data file, the file will be loaded into the 
grid when you press the Apply button.

TSuperGrid also adds an event to TStringGrid that allows you 
to override any color, or font choices that you made at design 
time, and specify new values for each cell.

25) 32bit\Super32.RES
26) 32bit\Colorpik.DCU

The following instructions refer to Delphi 1.0 menus, the procedure
is basicaly the same for Delphi 2.0

 1.Copy Super.HLP to a directory in your path, such as the 
   Windows directory, or the Delphi\Bin directory.
 2.Copy Super.KWF to the Delphi\Help directory.
 3.Run Helpinst.EXE, this program is located in the Delphi\Help 
   directory.
 4.Select File | Open to open Delphi.HDX, which is located in 
   your Delphi\Bin directory.
 5.Click on the green plus sign, to add the Super.KWF file.
 6.Once you added the file, select File | Save to compile and 
   save the Delphi.HDX file.
 7.Run Delphi and select Options | Install Components.
 8.Click on the Add button, and then Browse.
 9.Change the List Files Of Type box to show all *.DCU files.
10.Navigate to the directory where you unzipped the original 
   files and double click on the following file:

   For Delphi 1.0, select SuperReg.DCU
   For Delphi 2.0, select Super32.DCU

11.Back at the Install Components dialog, click on OK.
12.After Delphi is done building the component library and the 
   component palette is updated, you will see TSuperGrid as the
